As a part of my Combinatorial Games Project, I have written several code in varying languages. I have uploaded some of the finished ones here. I will soon upload the ruleset and some of the lemmas proven as well. In the meanwhile, you can play the game here: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2303277
